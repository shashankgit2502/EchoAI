      "content": "Shashank Singh is a strong candidate for an AI/ML Engineer role. His resume demonstrates a clear focus on AI and ML with hands-on experience in LLMs, Generative AI, RAG, agentic AI, and multi-agent systems. He is proficient in modern ML frameworks (Scikit-learn), Python, and has experience with backend development (FastAPI, Streamlit) and production deployment. The professional journey from SOTI into KPMG shows progression in technical depth and enterprise exposure, supplemented by relevant projects.\n\nStrengths:\n- Deep experience in generative AI and LLMs (OpenAI, LangChain, RAG, MCQ generator)\n- Strong backend and infrastructure skills (FastAPI, LangGraph, Kafka, Azure Foundry, MobiControl, MLOps tools, SSMS, DB management)\n- Production systems experience (KPMG executive software developer, agentic workflows, error handling, modular architecture)\n- Communication and teamwork, including client interaction\n- Educational background (BTech CS, 8.31 CGPA)\n- Active open-source community engagement (LangChain, FAISS, Agentic AI frameworks)\n\nAreas for improvement or gaps:\n- Limited experience in traditional ML pipelines and classical ML (Scikit-learn projects are basic and the background is mostly in generative AI and NLP)\n- Lack of explicit experience in data engineering, ETL pipelines, or big data tools (Apache Spark, Databricks)\n- No published research, open-source library contributions, or academic publications\n- Less direct machine learning model training, tuning, and deployment experience in production (though backend deployment is noted)\n- Gaps in cloud infrastructure beyond Azure Foundry (AWS, GCP, SageMaker, etc. not mentioned)\n- Lack of experience with computer vision, reinforcement learning, or deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) beyond basic usage\n\nOverall Fit Score: 82/100\n\nRecommendation: Move forward in the hiring process. Shashank Singh demonstrates a solid technical fit for an AI/ML Engineer role, especially for generative AI, LLMs, and agentic systems, with a track record in production and backend development. His skills are aligned closely with the modern demands of leading AI engineering positions. However, the resume could be strengthened by highlighting additional ML training, data engineering experience, and contributions to open-source or research, which would further improve the candidate\u2019s overall profile.",
